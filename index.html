            <p><em>Melty cheese combines with crispy hash browns and a gooey egg to  
                create diner breakfast flavors with a tex mex twist. Best part?  It 
                can be thrown together in about 15 minutes!</em></p></li>
        <li><a href="./recipes/Spicy-Tuna-Roll-Chicken-Salad.html"><h2>Spicy Tuna Roll Chicken Salad</h2></a>
            <p><em>This chicken salad includes so many of the great flavors that I 
                love in Japanese cuisine. It has umami flavors from furikake, miso,
                 and soy, freshness from pop of cucumber, and just a touch of sweet 
                 and spice. It’s like eating chicken salad that reminds you of a spicy
                  tuna sushi roll. You’re going to love it. </em></p></li>
        <li><a href="./recipes/Pasta-alla-Vodka.html"><h2>Pasta alla Vodka</h2></a>
            <p><em>Pasta alla vodka is one of THE MOST flavorful pastas and you
                 probably have what you need to make it in your pantry right now. If
                  you don't I'll give you options. </em></p></li>
