    <h1>Breakfast Tacos</h1>
      <img src="../recipes-links-and-images/breakfast-taco.jpeg">
      <h2><strong>Ingredients (makes 4 tacos):</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium russet potato (about 200g)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>100g Chihuahua cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>4 Corn tortillas</li>
            <li>4 Eggs</li>
            <li>Pico de gallo</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and grate the russer potato using the largest holes of a box 
                grater then squeeze out as much potato juice as possible.</li>
            <li>In a 12” non-stick or seasoned cast iron pan over med-high, heat 
                olive oil and add grated potatoes.</li>
            <li>Season with a strong pinch of salt and black pepper, spreading 
                potatoes out and pressing down with a spatula to ensure even browning. 
                Cook for about 8-10 minutes until crispy and golden brown, flipping 
                and breaking up the potatoes  halfway through.</li>
            <li>While hash browns are cooking, grate the cheese. </li>
            <li>When hash browns are browned, scoot them to the side of the pan, 
                add a bit of oil to the exposed half of the pan and add eggs (4 
                total or 1 per taco). Salt lightly. You’re cooking quickly so eggs 
                will take on color and get a bit crispy on the bottom. The potatoes 
                will continue to cook in the pan.</li>
            <li>While eggs cook, in another pan over low heat, warm the tortillas. 
                Flip tortilla over in pan once heated, then add a few pinches of the 
                grated chihuahua cheese to the top side. Add a lid to the pan to help 
                the cheese melt. </li>
            <li>When eggs have set on the bottom, flip to the second side for another 
                minute or 2 until yolk is just barely set, but still runny in the middle.</li>
            <li>Assemble the taco by placing the melty cheesed  tortilla on a plate, 
                adding about ¼ of the hash browns, a fried egg, pico de gallo, hot 
                sauce, and chopped cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
