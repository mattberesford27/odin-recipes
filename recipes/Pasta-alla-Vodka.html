    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium. Add 40g or
                 1/4c olive oil to the heavy bottomed pot, followed by 
                 shallots, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Stir and sweat for 
                 1-2 minutes. </li>
            <li>When translucent, add chile flake and calabrian chiles. 
                Stir to bloom for about a minute. </li>
            <li>Add tomato paste, stir and fry off raw flavor for about 2 
                minutes, stirring frequently. </li>
            <li>Add vodka. Stir and cook off alcohol.</li>
            <li>Once thickened and vodka has mostly evaporated, add cream. 
                Reduce heat to low and stir in hot water. </li>
            <li>Bring large pot of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>When pot of water is boiling, add two large handfuls of 
                salt followed by pasta.</li>
            <li>Stir and cook to al dente, somewhere around 8-10min. </li>
            <li>When done, drain water from pasta, reserving 1-2 cups 
                to adjust vodka sauce consistency if needed. </li>
            <li>Add drained pasta to vodka sauce, followed by butter and 
                around 1/2c or 120g pasta cooking liquid. Gently stir to 
                melt butter and combine. </li>
            <li>Once butter is melted in, add an additional 1/2c pasta
                 cooking liquid followed by parm. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir to combine. If needed, adjust 
                sauce consistency by adding more pasta water to thin it out
                 or more cheese and/or butter to thicken sauce. </li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed. Plate up and 
                garnish with a sprinkle of parm, black pepper, a sprinkle of 
                chile flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, and fresh basil if you 
                have it. </li>
        </ol>
