            <li>450g or 1lb chicken breast</li>
            <li>50g or 1/3c cucumbers, small diced</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>175g or 3/4c Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
            <li>30g or 1/4c scallions, chopped</li>
            <li>40g or 3Tbsp chopped sushi ginger (squeeze out excess liquid)</li>
            <li>30g or 2Tbsp white miso</li>
            <li>5g or 1tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>20g or 2Tbsp furikake</li>
            <li>30g or 2Tbsp sriracha</li>
            <li>10g or 2tsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2-3g or 1/2tsp sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To cook the chicken, salt well on both sides then allow to sit 
                and dry brine on a wire rack for around 15-20 minutes. </li>
            <li>Boil a pot of water, then reduce the heat to low until water 
                temp reaches 180F/82C (to test water temp, I just use my meat 
                thermometer)</li>
            <li>Stir a very large handful of salt into the water then gently 
                drop in the chicken breasts. This should drop the water temp to
                 about 165F/75C.  Poach for 20 minutes at a temp of 165F/75C. 
                <p><em>Note: if you’re poaching more than 2 breasts, the 
                    temperature may drop below 165F. If this happens, increase 
                    heat and monitor the water temp to keep it as close to
                     165F/75C as possible while poaching.  </em></p>
                <p>When cooked, the internal temp of the chicken should read 
                150-155F/65-68C. </p></li>
            <li>Season the diced cucumbers with a pinch of salt and a pinch of
                 sugar and let them cure and release their liquid for 15 minutes.
                  Drain off the liquid.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer bowl, combine the drained cucumbers, chopped 
                chicken breast, mayo, scallions, sushi ginger (chopped with excess 
                liquid squeezed off well), white miso, soy sauce, furikake, sriracha, 
                sugar, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.</li>
            <li>Mix on high speed for about 30-45 seconds until ingredients are combined 
                and chicken is somewhat shredded. 
                <p>If you don’t have a stand mixer, chop the chicken down well by hand, 
                    then add to a bowl and mix/whip well by hand, making sure to shred 
                    some of the chicken as you mix. </p> </li>
            <li>Serve on a squishy toasted brioche bun</li>
        </ol>
